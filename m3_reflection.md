CS 211 - Milestone 3 Reflection - Card Deck
Autumn Ossello

2/21	In today’s lab I researched different shuffling techniques with linked lists and attempted three different approaches, some of which did not function in the expected way, others I was unable to decipher and apply to my project. I separately added the buttons for each function in the class diagram based on the button creation for the previous milestone. I was unable to test functionality at this point, although the buttons appear as expected.

2/26	Today I revisited the shuffle function with the intention of converting the linked list Cards to an array and swapping card locations. Using various online sources I determined how to initialize the type of array I wanted and how to use Random. This tripped me up for a bit before I realized Unity’s random had different syntax than the System’s random. I ended up emptying the linked list with new and refilling it with the shuffled values from the array.
	After I completed the shuffle function I revisited the milestone requirements and reviewed the class diagram. I created the merge function for multiple decks by walking through the new deck and adding each of them to the end of the main deck.

2/28	In Lab I struggled with button implementation, I found myself running into error after error and nothing I did was changing anything so I ended up reinstating the previous build. I began again, and went through two more failed unrecoverable builds before returning and creating a Game Manager object to use for the object of my OnClick in the buttons. I created trigger functions in the Game Manager script that called the functions in the deck script and attached the trigger functions to the buttons. The add to buttons currently take a new card because they wouldn’t be able to trigger from OnClick if they take a parameter. At this point my buttons function, although it has now been hours of staring at this and I’m not sure how if at all it’s affecting the actual deck. The deck at this point is just a LinkedList of 52 cards, and I assume they are able to be shuffled and merged but they have not been tested. In clicking the buttons all errors are resolved but I’m not sure how to get the cards to appear or how to tag the meshes so they’re discoverable. 

This biggest difficulty with this project was that I don’t understand what MonoBehavior actually does and where I can and cannot implement it. It’s also not clear to me exactly how to create objects and make them appear on the scene, and the relationship between meshes and materials and images and how to implement them on game objects. The actual code went fairly easily, excepting the unity specific terms and those unique to C#. Tutorials or guides isolating particular aspects of unity such as creating a new instance or instantiating an object would be helpful, as with the whole beginning to end creating tutorials I found myself struggling to keep up with all the new material presented at once.
